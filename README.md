# malware_town
Malware repository for research purposes.
The repository is divided by typology.
At the moment, the collection is focused on PEs.

Naming convention:
* files are labelled with their MD5
* encrypted with 7zip
* protected with password "infected"
* when both the packed and unpacked versions are present, the unpacked archive will get the packed MD5 as name, followed by "_unpacked"
