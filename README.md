# malware_town
Malware repository for research purposes.
The repository is divided by typology.
Currently, the collection is focused on PEs.

Naming conventions:
* Files are labelled with their MD5.
* Encrypted with 7zip.
* Protected with password "infected".
* When both the packed and unpacked versions are present, the unpacked archive will get the packed MD5 as name, followed by "_unpacked" signature.
