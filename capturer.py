"""
We use this simple script to capture execution data about the samples.
It uses 2 VMs, a Linux Remnux to emulate network services and a Windows 10 x64 Remnux Workstation
as a malware execution lab.

ASSUMPTIONS
1) You have virtualbox installed on your host.
2) You have virtualbox SDK installed on your host.
3) You have a windows VM set up.
4) Your VM has a configured shared folder with guest rights to write in it.
5) You have noriben installed in your VM (hence Python3).
6) You have procmon installed in your VM.
7) All the samples are 7-zipped with password within the same directory (as in the Malware Town repo).
8) All the samples are named with their md5.

It is paramount that you correctly set the following variables (in caps).
